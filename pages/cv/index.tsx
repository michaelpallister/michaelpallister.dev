          <p>Northern Stable would help people take their ideas to market.</p>
          <p>
            We would build products that people could take into the world and

          </p>
          <p>
            Whilst working there I helped launch include the UK&apos;s fastest
            growing digital appointments app, a referral network, a suit of
            products helping clients covert customers across e-commerce and the
            gambling industry and a video email SaaS.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also tasked with supporting the other companies that had
            gained successful funding and started building out their own dev
            teams with their frontend needs. Whether it was a feature that needs
            building, consultation, planning of upcoming features, API design or
            any general questions they had.

          <p>
            I worked across a range of products whilst working at Cookies. I
            helped build an interactive video platform that worked in a similar
            way to Netflix&apos;s Bandersnatch where the user can decide the
            journey the film they&apos;re watching would take.

          <p>
            I also worked with the BBC to develop the BBC Maestro video content
            platform, providing online video courses from some of the most
            famous names across the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also created the initial web and iOS app MVP for a senior citizen
            monitoring health app. The app, aimed at care homes and families who
            wanted to monitor their relatives more would provide alerts to a
            user should certain conditions not be met. The app gained successful
            funding from a Canadian health organisation.

            I helped the business transition its presence online from a B2B only
            company to a B2B/B2C company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being the largest electrical wholesaler in the UK we had to ensure
            that the change wouldn&apos;t cause any issues for our existing
            business customers, whilst fulfilling the demands and expectations
            of our new customers who were shopping with us for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            My role involved a lot of performance work, focussing on driving
            down the page size, increasing the speed and optimising the customer
            journey so that we could get them to the product they needed
            quicker.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also responsible for starting the frontend component library
            and mentoring junior developers, as well as helping the wider
            members of the business with any queries they had related to the
            frontend of the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            During my time we also rolled out the companies first ever mobile
            app on both Apple and Android devices. I was heavily involved in
            building out the frontend of the app in React Native and the API
            that went with it.

          <p>
            Before leaving, I was also part of a small team that was tasked with

            Working as part of the R&amp;D team I was responsible for moving the
            frontend of the codebase forward. Trying to always be ahead of the
            curve in e-commerce and giving clients access to features they
            needed before they knew they needed them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I helped plan and build the companies first responsive website,
            which then led to re-writing the component library to be responsive
            so we could roll these features out to other clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also part of a small team that rolled out the coding standards
            documentation to the company for all developers and alongside the
            frontend team as a whole we built a set of linting rules which we
            would use and adapt going forward.

            I was responsible for maintaining and developing the University
            website, across the full-stack. This meant I was creating prototypes
            for features which I would then design and present to the team
            before I eventually building out the features.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside this, we were building a completely bespoke CMS to make it
            easier for internal departments to update their area&apos;s of the
            website.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also building internal tooling and reports, allowing
            departments to visualise the data we were collecting on the site
            quicker and easier.

            I helped build the customer knowledge base. This allowed customers
            to search for their question before submitting it to the support
            team. This resulted in cutting the number of support requests we had
            down drastically and meant the support team could focus more on the
            customers who needed support instead of &quot;how to&quot; type
            questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also creating sites from PSDs supplied by the designers. I
            noticed a lot of repeat components and featured. I started to
            document these and this led to me being moved into a role where I
            was helping build out a the first version of the a component library
            which would then be used by all developers to cut down the build
            time of any site.
