          <p className='intro__p'>
            I have over a decades worth of experience working in the industry
            after graduating from Teesside University with a degree in Web
            Design.
          </p>

          <p className='intro__p'>
            I&apos;ve worked with everyone from small agencies to large
            companies and in teams of varying sizes. I like semantics,
            performance and the little details.
          </p>

          <p className='intro__p'>
            I&apos;ve worked with a range of languages and technologies, some
            that I have listed some below. The ever changing nature of the
            frontend makes it hard to keep up with everything. However, in my
            free time I enjoy keeping up with the Jamstack community, improving
            my accessibility knowledge and the possibilities around edge
            computing.

          <p className='job__date'>January 2022 - Present</p>
          <p>
            Stinkyink is one of the largest ink and toner retailers in the UK.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;ve massively improved the performance of the web app. The
            average page size has more than halved with no real change to the
            content or design on these pages.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;ve also built an internal browser extension that helps the
            customer services team with some of their daily tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;m also forming some brand guidelines, a component library,
            planning the migration of a extensive legacy codebase to Typescript,
            creating a test suite for the frontend, building out any new
            features required, re-designing and building internal dashboards and
            helping with an architecture review and upgrade.

          <p>
            Northern Stable would invest in ideas and build products that people
            could take into the world and help them gain further funding through
            investment or sales.
          </p>
          <p>
            I helped launch the UK&apos;s fastest-growing digital appointments
            app, a referral network, a suite of products aimed at converting
            customers in the e-commerce and gambling industries and a video
            email SaaS web app and browser extension.
          </p>
          <p>
            I would also support the companies that had gained successful
            funding and started building their dev teams with their frontend
            needs. This could be a feature that needs writing, consultation on
            an idea, help planning upcoming features, API design or any
            questions they had.

          <p>
            I worked across a range of products whilst working at Cookies. I
            helped build an interactive video platform that worked like
            Netflix&apos;s Bandersnatch where the user can decide the journey
            the film they&apos;re watching would take.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also worked with the BBC to develop the BBC Maestro video content
            platform, providing online video courses from some of the most
            famous names across the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also created the initial web and iOS app MVP for a senior citizen
            monitoring health app. The app, aimed at care homes and families who
            wanted to monitor their relatives would provide alerts to a user
            should certain conditions not be met. The app gained successful
            funding from a Canadian health organisation.

          <p>
            I helped the business transition its presence online from a B2B only
            company to a B2B/B2C company.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being the largest electrical wholesaler in the UK we had to ensure
            that the change wouldn&apos;t cause any issues for our existing
            business customers, whilst fulfilling the demands and expectations
            of our new customers who were shopping with us for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            My role involved a lot of performance work, focussing on driving
            down the page size, increasing the speed and optimising the customer
            journey.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also responsible for starting the frontend component library,
            mentoring junior developers and helping any other colleagues with
            any queries they had related to the frontend of the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also rolled out the company&apos;s first mobile app on both Apple
            and Android devices. I was heavily involved in building out the
            frontend of the app in React Native and the API that went with it.

            Before leaving, I was also part of a small team that was tasked with

            As part of the R&amp;D team I was responsible for improving and
            modernising a large codebase. I&apos;d be looking to always be ahead
            of the curve in e-commerce by providing features and updates for our
            clients that meant they would stay ahead in their markets.
          </p>
          <p>
            I helped plan and build the company&apos;s first responsive website,
            this then led to re-writing the component library to be responsive
            so we could roll the new designs out to our clients.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also part of a small team that created the coding standards
            documentation for all developers and the linting rules.

            I was responsible for maintaining and developing the
            University&apos;s website and internal tools, taking ideas from a
            prototype to a finished feature. I was designing and working across
            the full stack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Alongside this, I was helping build a completely bespoke CMS that
            allowed internal departments to update the areas of the website they
            owned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Writing internal tooling, building dashboards and reports that
            allowed departments to visualise the data we were collecting was a
            big part of the job.

            I helped build the customer knowledge base. This would allow
            customers to search for their questions before submitting them to
            the support team. These changes resulted in the number tickets we
            had drastically falling and meant the support team could focus more
            on the customers who needed support instead of &quot;how-to&quot;
            type questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was also initially creating sites from PSDs supplied by the
            in-house design team. I started to noticed a lot of repeat
            components and features. Because of this I started to document my
            findings. I was then moved into a role where I was tasked with
            building out the first version of a component library. The library
            would later be used by all the development teams to reduce the build
            time of any project.
